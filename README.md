# BW2_examples

Notebooks containing some sample uses of Brightway2 for Life Cycle Assessment.

Brightway is a Python-based LCA framework. It is powerful, but I needed to invest lots of time ot learn it.

Captured here are some Notebooks that started off as notes and experiments to learn and somehow evolved in sample code that could be of some use to those starting off.

Any comments/additions are of course welcome!
